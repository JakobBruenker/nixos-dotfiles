    # hm, I'm not sure how much I really like home manager since you can only

    # for programs for which home manager doesn't have configuration options, you
    # can use it to manage your dotfiles, e.g.
    # home.file.".config/i3blocks/config".source = "${my-dotfile-dir}/i3blocks.conf"

    # home-manager -f dotfiles/home.nix

    # unless of course they have an option for it already
    # doesn't really look like it though
